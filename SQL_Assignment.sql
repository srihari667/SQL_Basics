1. Create the employees table with constraints
*/
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000
);

/*
2. Purpose of constraints
Constraints enforce rules at table level to maintain data integrity.
Examples include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.
*/

/*
3. Why use NOT NULL and can PRIMARY KEY be NULL?
NOT NULL ensures mandatory fields.
PRIMARY KEY cannot be NULL because it uniquely identifies each record.
*/

/*
4. Add and remove constraints on an existing table
*/
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_age CHECK (age >= 18);
/*
To remove (MySQL 8+):
ALTER TABLE employees DROP CHECK chk_age;
*/

/*
5. Consequences of violating constraints
E.g., inserting duplicate value in UNIQUE field gives an error:
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry for key 'email'
*/

/*
6. Modify 'products' table
*/
ALTER TABLE products ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

What is Normalization?
Normalization is organizing data to reduce redundancy.

2NF: No partial dependencies
3NF: No transitive dependencies
